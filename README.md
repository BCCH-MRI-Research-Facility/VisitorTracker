# VisitorTracker
A Shiny visitor tracker for the BCCH MRI Research Facility.

The visitor tracker takes in information about the visitor, logs it in the database file for 30 days, then deletes the visitor record after 30 days.  

Initially built for COVID tracking at the BCCH MRI Research Facility.
